;;; Commentary:

;; dayone.el is a simple emacs extension for placing the new post from
;; the emacs to Day One(http://dayoneapp.com).  It can post the
;; region when the concerned region is selected and M-x dayone-add-note.
;; When the region is not selected and M-x dayone-add-note is executed,
;; the all contents in the buffer are posted.
;; M-x dayone-add-note-with-tag shall be posted by attaching the tag.
;; When multiple tags are attached, use the space key for separating
;; each tag.
;; As for dayone-add-note() and dayone-add-note-with-tag,, it may be
;; convenient if you assign it to an appropriate key or add alias.
;; For the Day One, the data is managed by either the iCloud or the
;; Dropbox. This emacs extension is supported for storing data of
;; Dropbox only.

;;; Setting:

;; (require 'dayone)
;; (setq dayone-dir (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Dropbox/APP/Day One/Journal.dayone/entries/"))
;; (setq dayone-timezone "America/Sao_Paulo")
